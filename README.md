100DaysOfPython
Welcome to the 100DaysOfPython challenge! üöÄ

This repository contains 100 Python projects and exercises, one for each day, starting from Day 1 to Day 100. Each day, there will be a new project or exercise aimed at helping you improve your Python skills. By the end of this challenge, you will have a broad range of projects under your belt and a deeper understanding of Python programming.

üìú About the Challenge
The 100DaysOfPython challenge is designed to progressively take you through various Python projects, from beginner to intermediate level. Each day introduces new concepts and techniques that will help solidify your Python knowledge.

The goal:
Build 100 small projects and exercises in 100 days.
Master Python syntax, libraries, and tools.
Gain practical experience with problem-solving, algorithms, and coding challenges.
By completing the 100DaysOfPython challenge, you'll not only sharpen your Python skills but also build a portfolio of diverse projects that can be shared with future employers or the open-source community.

üöÄ How to Get Started
To begin your journey with the 100DaysOfPython challenge, follow these simple steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/100DaysOfPython.git
cd 100DaysOfPython
Install Python 3.x if you haven't already:

Python Downloads
Start working on Day 1:

Navigate to the corresponding folder for each day, start the project or complete the exercise, and run it!
Track your progress:

Each day you complete, feel free to create a pull request or simply take notes about what you've learned.
üóìÔ∏è Daily Challenges
Each day is designed with a unique exercise or project. Here's an outline of how each day will be structured:

Day 1 to Day 20: Introduction to Python syntax, basic algorithms, and data types (strings, lists, etc.).
Day 21 to Day 40: Intermediate topics such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and working with files.
Day 41 to Day 60: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, and error handling.
Day 61 to Day 80: Advanced Python topics, working with external libraries, and mini-projects.
Day 81 to Day 100: Real-world projects, web development, automation, and APIs.
Every project will come with clear instructions, and most of them can be completed in less than an hour, but will help you build on your skills progressively.

üß∞ Requirements
To run the projects, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x (preferably the latest version)
Basic knowledge of Python (for beginners)
A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
Additional libraries (will be mentioned in each project)
